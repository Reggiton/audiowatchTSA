**Welcome to AudioWatch** 

**Need**

People with hearing disabilities cannot react to environmental sounds (doorbell, sirens, alarms) compared to someone with normal hearing. Studies have shown that deaf pedestrians in accidents are more likely to get head and neck injuries compared to others, signaling that the limited access to auditory traffic cues may increase the risk of severe impacts. This indicates an urgent need for improved visual alerts, safer urban crossing designs, and awareness campaigns tailored to the deaf community. Many testimonials have also been made apparent by people of the deaf community, stating that they struggle finding, or use many non-effective ways of telling that someone is at their door, or alarms and bedshakers to wake up. This lack of attention towards 15% of the American population that struggle with hearing loss must be addressed, which is why we aim to fix that.

**Solution**

A mobile or smartwatch app that recognizes key sounds and translates them into vibrations or screen alerts!
